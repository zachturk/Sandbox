Notes for this repo:
(I haven't actually come up w/ a specific plan for this repo, but it's handy to be able to have a
 way to sync files across multiple machines from CLI.  Even though it's public, this still seems
 simpler than dropbox or googledocs or others)

todo: things I should do sometime in the future.
